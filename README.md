# ESP8266-Coffee-Maker
I created a web server on esp8266(NodeMCU) and assigned a static ip. Inside the esp8266 code, I also created a user interface to command the device. Than I connected the esp8266 to my coffee machine's switch. This way the user can navigate to the local ip address and make some coffee while away from the coffee machine.
